<u>my spotify interface</u>

pulls each word from an insult from the elizabethan insult api to build a playlist comprising of those same words

the intended output would be a spotify playlist whereby the songs can be read as an acrostic for the insult



you will need:

the elizabethan api (no key needed)

https://quandyfactory.com/insult

JSON link:

https://quandyfactory.com/insult/json



for the spotify keys, i used this format:

```
{
'username': 'spotify username',
 'client_id': '...',
 'client_secret': '...',
 'redirect': 'https://www.google.com/'
 }
```

news key is in separate txt doc on its own
